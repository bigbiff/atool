Tools for android development.

'apktool' is the sole available tool so far. It can parse android 
compiled xml files and resource table file (resources.arsc), then 
dump plain xml files almost the same as the originals. System
resources will be auto loaded from android sdk directory if it can
be resolved. Usage is as follows:

# dump one xml
$ apktool dumpxml <binary-xml> [resources.arsc]

# dump all xml in apk
$ apktool dumpapk <file-apk>
